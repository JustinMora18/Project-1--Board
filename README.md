## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

 - [ ] Matching the layout from a Figma design exactly with CSS.
    - [ ] Making sure that the card content (title, image, blur) was stacked and positioned properly.
- [ ] Avoiding horizontal scroll and ensuring proper alignment of the title with the card grid.
    - [ ] Working with React and Vite was a bit challenging at first, since it was my first time using them.
